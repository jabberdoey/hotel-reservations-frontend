## Prerequisites

This frontend app requires the [backend](https://github.com/rabyyuson/hotel-reservations) service to be running. To do so create a `.env` file and add in the following:

```bash
BACKEND_API=http://localhost:3000/api/v1/reservations
```

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to start interacting with the application.
